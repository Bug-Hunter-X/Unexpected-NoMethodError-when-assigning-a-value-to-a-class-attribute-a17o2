# Ruby NoMethodError when assigning to an attribute

This repository demonstrates a common Ruby error: a `NoMethodError` occurring when trying to modify a class attribute that doesn't have a defined setter method.  The `bug.rb` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.rb` presents a solution.

The error arises from a misunderstanding of how Ruby handles attribute access and modification.  Proper encapsulation and the use of setter methods are crucial for avoiding this.
